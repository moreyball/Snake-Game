# Snake-Game
This is a rather unique snake game. First, the introduction text, the monster and the snake are all made using turtle graphics. When the user clicks on the screen, the text is deleted, the game starts and the monster starts moving, on every screen update the monster recalibrates its movement towards the snake head. The method ontimer() is used to update the snake’s and monster’s movement. When the snake first starts moving it stamps itself until it has a body length of 5. Each of the body segment position and the snake head position is recorded and updated on every screen update. This is used to identify the collision between the snake and the monster. When the snake collides with a “food number”, its snake length variable length increases, triggering the snake to expand itself.
